# Git Clone
## For projects created from GitHub.com

* Add a new repo on GitHub
* Initialize w/a README
* Add a gitignore that relates to your project (i.e. Node for JavaScript)

Now your project is empty and on GitHub

Clone it down:

`git clone #{repo_url}`

`cd` into your new project directory (it was created for you with git clone)

You now have a local copy of your Git repo. Use your usual commands to interact with it (i.e. `git commit`, `git add`, `git push`, etc.

To add collaborators (needed if you want a partner pushing up to your repo) go to settings, collaborators, and add them with their GitHub username.
